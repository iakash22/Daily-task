## Description

  ```base
  I've developed a task management website with robust security features and efficient user management using the Clerk authentication tool. To store and manage data, I've employed Prisma for database operations and schema design, ensuring optimal data organization. For data validation, I've integrated Zod, which enhances data integrity and user input validation.

  The core functionality of the platform revolves around creating task collections and managing individual tasks within them. Users can seamlessly create collections to categorize their tasks and set expiration dates for each task. 

  The Clerk authentication tool not only guarantees secure user access but also simplifies the registration and login process. It provides a seamless user experience while ensuring data privacy and security.

  Overall, my task management website leverages the power of Prisma for robust data storage, Zod for data validation, and Clerk for secure user management. This combination results in a highly efficient and user-friendly platform that empowers individuals to organize and manage their tasks effectively, ensuring they never miss important deadlines
